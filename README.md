# sudokuSolver
An algorithm that can fill up the empty spaces of a 2 dimensional nxm board based on the rules of sudoku.
Basically, the goal is to develop a software that can take a 2-dimensional array with some empty space as input and look up potential integers (like 0-9) that can be used to fill the space without deviating from the sudoku rules.
